# loop of stars using while loop 
i = 0 # i should define i and put a start point (0) 
while i <= 5: # i need the 5th line because of this i put <=
    print("*" * i)  # my code should print in first loop print 1 star because i=1, 2nd loop i=2 * (*) =** , 3rd loop i=3 *(*) = *** ,..... 
    i+=1        # in each loop i should add 1 after doing the all code above it  , and i choose while loop because i know the range of the loop
